# Partner and Spouse Email Greeting

Changes the Email Greeting to include the First Name of a Contact having an active Relationship of type: Partner Of or Spouse Of. For example: "Dear Fran and Justin", instead of the default "Dear Fran".

This allows emails to be sent to Contacts which have a shared email account and address both Contacts in the email.

Email Greeting will be changed to include the First Name of the related Contact when a Relationship of type: **Partner Of** or **Spouse Of** is **added** or **enabled**.

Email Greeting will be **reverted** to the standard greeting if these relationships are **deleted** or **disabled**.

If the related Contact does **not** have a **First Name** set, then the standard greeting will be set.
